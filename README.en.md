SymbolLattice builds a queryable local code-symbol graph for a project. Every relation keeps its rule, resolution stage, and confidence; `exact`, `heuristic`, and `unresolved` evidence are never conflated.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer, below 25, and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HsinPu/symbol-lattice.git
cd symbol-lattice
npm install
npm run build

# Explicitly create a local index
node dist/cli/main.js init /path/to/project

# Read-only queries; explicitly synchronize after source changes
node dist/cli/main.js routes --project /path/to/project --method GET
node dist/cli/main.js sync /path/to/project

# Start a read-only MCP host
node dist/cli/main.js serve --mcp --project /path/to/project
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `npm.cmd` if `npm` is unavailable. Index data stays in the target project's `.symbol-lattice/index.sqlite`.

## v0.165.0 highlights

- Django `path`, bounded static `re_path`, and legacy `django.conf.urls.url` now recognize exact same-file `LocalClass.as_view()` routes.
- Existing static URLConf `include(...)` projection carries those class targets through relative imports, literal URLConfs, and final package-initializer re-exports.
- Every relation preserves its route factory, `class-as-view` handler shape, and auditable evidence rule for querying, impact analysis, and debugging.

## Principles

- Indexing and querying stay local; source is never silently uploaded.
- `init` and `sync` are explicit writes. CLI and MCP queries remain read-only and never update the graph themselves.
- A relation needs reproducible static evidence. Otherwise it remains unresolved instead of guessed.

## Static-analysis boundaries

- Cross-file Python routing covers FastAPI `include_router`, Flask `register_blueprint`, Sanic `app.blueprint`, and Django `path`, bounded `re_path`, and legacy `url` `include(...)` mounts.
- Django `Class.as_view()` accepts only an undecorated, unique, top-level local class declared before final `urlpatterns` without rebinding; the call must be direct and argument-free. It does not infer framework inheritance or runtime `as_view` behavior.
- Dynamic composition, external or namespace packages, parent-relative imports, copied or container values, decorated or imported classes, WebSockets, `add_route`, versioning, and ambiguous targets never become `exact` results.

## Verification

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
git diff --check
```
