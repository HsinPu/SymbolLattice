> [!IMPORTANT]
> v0.351.0 is a developer preview. MCP query tools are read-only, but `serve --mcp` starts a separate local auto-sync watcher by default. That watcher may update the project's `.symbol-lattice` index; add `--no-auto-sync` to disable it.

## What it is

SymbolLattice scans a local repository, persists a code graph, and exposes CLI/MCP queries for:

- Files, symbols, calls, imports, inheritance, routes, and entry points.
- Callers, callees, impact, affected paths, context, and cross-file exploration.
- Source ranges, resolution stages, confidence, and rule evidence for every relationship.

Relationships that cannot be proven exactly remain unresolved or pending instead of becoming false exact edges.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js `>=22.13 <25` and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HsinPu/symbol-lattice.git
cd symbol-lattice
npm install
npm run build

# Build a local graph
node dist/cli/main.js init /path/to/project

# Refresh it
node dist/cli/main.js sync /path/to/project

# Basic queries
node dist/cli/main.js files --project /path/to/project --json
node dist/cli/main.js find createOrder --project /path/to/project --json
node dist/cli/main.js callees createOrder --project /path/to/project --json
node dist/cli/main.js routes --project /path/to/project --json

# Bounded cross-file context for an agent
node dist/cli/main.js explore "Trace createOrder to persistence" --project /path/to/project --json
```

## v0.351.0 usability snapshot

The repeatable smoke matrix checks committed cases against the exported language and framework registries instead of treating README claims as proof.

- Twenty-two priority languages complete `init`, no-op `sync`, changed `sync`, file inventory, and full-identity symbol lookup. Twenty-one pass B1 relation receipts; Ruby remains partial.
- Lua reaches B1 through an exact Lapis literal-route-to-local-handler relation. General Lua direct calls remain fail-closed because of reflection. Luau accepts only a bounded, unique, unmodified same-file zero-argument bare call.
- Pascal accepts only declaration-before-use calls between unique global routines. Units, `uses`, owners, nested routines, include directives, shadows, and multiple candidates fail closed.
- R and Clojure reach B1 through exact Plumber and Compojure literal-route-to-handler relations. General direct calls remain disabled because environment or Var mutation and quoted forms cannot yet be proven safely.
- Language route receipts bind the complete handler identity and edge endpoints and require `resolution: exact` with `confidence: 1`; heuristic or same-path wrong-handler records cannot pass B1.
- Groovy, CFML, and Ruby remain conservative partials for general calls. Later batches will use provable routes, file references, or another non-dynamic relation instead.
- Representative React Router, Next.js, Vue Router, SvelteKit, Astro, Spring Web, FastAPI, Django, and ASP.NET Core cases produce the expected route.
- Nuxt Vue files scan and query successfully, but there is no dedicated Nuxt route capability yet.

The exported registry covers more languages and frameworks than this first batch. Entries do not imply equal depth until they pass the same matrix.

## MCP

```bash
node dist/cli/main.js serve --mcp --project /path/to/project

# Disable background index updates completely
node dist/cli/main.js serve --mcp --project /path/to/project --no-auto-sync
```

MCP queries do not directly run `init` or `sync`. Use the CLI's `init`, `sync`, `watch`, or an explicitly approved watcher flow when you need to control indexing.

## Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | Build a project graph. |
| `sync` | Explicitly synchronize the index. |
| `status` | Inspect generation and freshness. |
| `files` / `file` | List or read persisted source. |
| `find` / `node` | Find and inspect a symbol. |
| `callers` / `callees` | Query static call relationships. |
| `routes` / `entrypoints` | Inspect framework routes and entry points. |
| `impact` / `affected` | Run bounded impact analysis. |
| `context` / `explore` | Retrieve agent-ready code context. |
| `explain-edge` | Inspect the complete evidence for one edge. |

Run `node dist/cli/main.js <command> --help` for all options.

## Limits

SymbolLattice is a static code graph and code intelligence tool. It is not a complete compiler, type checker, runtime tracer, RDF ontology, or general reasoning engine. Dynamic dispatch, reflection, macros, code generation, dependency injection, and external package types may remain unresolved.

## Verification

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run benchmark:capabilities
npm run verify:mcp-worker-generation
npm run benchmark:mcp
npm run benchmark:comparison
npm pack --dry-run
```
